# Virtual-Art-Gallery
## Project Description in Detail

This project is the solution to an HTML assignment with the objective of creating a single-page virtual art gallery using **pure HTML5**â€”no external CSS or JavaScript is utilized. The gallery showcases five distinct artworks to demonstrate various HTML structural and formatting elements as per the assignment requirements.

### Features Implemented:

* **HTML Boilerplate:** Includes `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, and `<body>`.
* **Structure & Semantics:** Extensive use of `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>` for hierarchy, and `<section>` tags for content grouping.
* **Comments:** HTML comments are used to logically divide and describe different sections of the page.
* **Text Formatting:** Demonstrates the use of `<b>` (bold), `<i>` (italic), `<u>` (underline), and `<del>` (deleted text).
* **Separators:** Uses `<hr>` (horizontal rule) to visually separate major sections and `<br>` (line breaks) within paragraphs.
* **Images:** Five images are included with descriptive `alt` text and specified `width` and `height` attributes.
* **Anchors (Links):**
    * Internal links (`#`) are used for navigation between the gallery index and individual artworks.
    * One external link (`target="_blank"`) is included.
* **Lists:**
    * An **Unordered List (`<ul>`)** details the materials used, demonstrating the `type` attribute.
    * An **Ordered List (`<ol>`)** outlines steps, demonstrating the `value` attribute on one `<li>`.
* **Table:** A comparison table (`<table>`) is included to compare the five artworks by title, artist, medium, and year.
